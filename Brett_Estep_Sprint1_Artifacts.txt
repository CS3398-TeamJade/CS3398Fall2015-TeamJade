For sprint1 (Labeled Sprint 2) I watched many Django Videos to try and understand the process
I watched the entire 42 videos in the series which starts at URL:

I had to watch many of them again because it was confusing to me. (This took ten hours or more)

Attempted to create a prototype for the team. (I spent about 2 hours on this)

This led into Sprint 2 where we decided what to push towards next.
