For this sprint my role was "backup." So I did tutorials over python and Django so I could be helpful to my team if they needed me. 

First, I did a majority of the python tutorial on codeacademy.com. I found it facinating how versatile python is and how lenient the syntax is. For example,
how there isn't necessarily a main function. Very interesting and a good fit for web development. 

I also watched video tutorials about Django. They are listed below:

All were incredibly unhelpful and VERY boring. Mostly what I found confusing was how you had to tell the code via commandline to look for a specific file
before that file would actually work with the rest of the project. Just strange. The most helpful tutorial(not a video) is listed below:

It starts you off from scratch and works you into an actual project. Although I didn't do it myself, reading through it helped me understand a little bit 
better how Django works with other files, etc..
